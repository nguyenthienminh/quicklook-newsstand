# QuickLook source code for the Newsstand folder #
## Just what is in here? ##
This repository has some files written in Objective-C (yes, Objective-C) that are made with the QuickLook framework for the Newsstand folder that was in iOS 5 - 8. 
## But why? ##
This project is to basically revive the Newsstand folder for the community, so it has a better use.
## Build instructions ##
*Also, just for your sakeness, there's no pre-built stuff (so you could customize the app to your liking), so you have to build it yourself. It's pretty easy though, as it doesn't involve command-line knowledge.*
